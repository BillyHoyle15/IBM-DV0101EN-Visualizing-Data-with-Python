'''-------------------------PIE CHARTS------------------------------'''
'''A pie chart is a circualr graphic that displays numeric proportions by 
dividing a circle (or pie) into proportional slices. You are most likely 
already familiar with pie charts as it is widely used in business and media. 
We can create pie charts in Matplotlib by passing in the kind=pie keyword.

Question: Using a pie chart, explore the proportion (percentage) of new 
immigrants grouped by continents in the year 2013.

Step 1: Gather data.

We will use pandas groupby method to summarize the immigration data by 
Continent. The general process of groupby involves the following steps:

Split: Splitting the data into groups based on some criteria.
Apply: Applying a function to each group independently:
.sum()
.count()
.mean() 
.std() 
.aggregate()
.apply()
.etc..
Combine: Combining the results into a data structure.'''

## group countries by continents and apply sum() function 
df_continents = df_can.groupby('Continent', axis=0).sum()

## note: the output of the groupby method is a `groupby' object. 
## we can not use it further until we apply a function (eg .sum())
print(type(df_can.groupby('Continent', axis=0)))

#df_continents.head()

'''Step 2: Plot the data. We will pass in kind = 'pie' keyword, along with the 
following additional parameters:
    
autopct - is a string or function used to label the wedges with their numeric 
value. The label will be placed inside the wedge. If it is a format string, 
the label will be fmt%pct.
startangle - rotates the start of the pie chart by angle degrees 
counterclockwise from the x-axis.
shadow - Draws a shadow beneath the pie (to give a 3D feel).'''

## autopct create %, start angle represent starting point
#df_continents['Total'].plot(kind='pie',
#                            figsize=(5, 6),
#                            autopct='%1.1f%%', # add in percentages
#                            startangle=90,     # start angle 90Â° (Africa)
#                            shadow=True,       # add shadow

#
#plt.show()

'''The above visual is not very clear, the numbers and text overlap in some 
instances. Let us make a few modifications to improve the visuals:

Remove the text labels on the pie chart by passing in legend and add it as 
a seperate legend using plt.legend().

Push out the percentages to sit just outside the pie chart by passing in 
pctdistance parameter.

Pass in a custom set of colors for continents by passing in colors parameter.

Explode the pie chart to emphasize the lowest three continents (Africa, 
North America, and Latin America and Carribbean) by pasing in explode parameter.'''

'''------------------------BOX PLOTS--------------------------------'''
'''A box plot is a way of statistically representing the distribution of the 
##data through five main dimensions:

##Minimun: Smallest number in the dataset.
##First quartile: Middle number between the minimum and the median.
##Second quartile (Median): Middle number of the (sorted) dataset.
##Third quartile: Middle number between median and maximum.
##Maximum: Highest number in the dataset.

##To make a box plot, we can use kind=box in plot method invoked on a 
##series or dataframe.

##Question: Plot the box plot for the Japanese immigrants between 1980 - 2013.

##Step 1: Get the data set. Even though we are pulling info for just one country, 
##we will obtain it as a dataframe. This will help us with calling the 
##dataframe.describe() method to view the percentiles.'''


## to get a dataframe, place extra square brackets around 'Japan'.
#df_japan = df_can.loc[['Japan'], years].transpose()
##df_japan.head()
#
#df_japan.plot(kind='box', figsize=(8, 6))
#
#plt.title('Box plot of Japanese Immigrants from 1980 - 2013')
#plt.ylabel('Number of Immigrants')
#
#plt.show()

'''We can immediately make a few key observations from the plot above:

The minimum number of immigrants is around 200 (min), maximum number is around 
1300 (max), and median number of immigrants is around 900 (median).
25% of the years for period 1980 - 2013 had an annual immigrant count of 
~500 or fewer (First quartile).
75% of the years for period 1980 - 2013 had an annual immigrant count of 
~1100 or fewer (Third quartile).
We can view the actual numbers by calling the describe() 
method on the dataframe.'''

#df_japan.describe()

'''One of the key benefits of box plots is comparing the distribution of 
multiple datasets. In one of the previous modules(see Week1), we observed that 
China and India had very similar immigration trends. Let us analyize 
further using box plots.

Question: Compare the distribution of the number of new immigrants from 
India and China for the period 1980 - 2013.

Step 1: Get the data set for China and India.'''

#df_CI= df_can.loc[['China', 'India'], years].transpose()
#
#print(df_CI.head())
#df_CI.describe()
#
#'''Step 2: Plot data. We can pass in vert keyword to create a horizontal 
#box plot as follows:'''
#
## let's create the box plot
#df_CI.plot(kind='box', figsize=(10, 7), color='blue', vert=False)
#
#plt.title('Box plots of Immigrants from China and India (1980 - 2013)')
#plt.xlabel('Number of Immigrants')
#
#plt.show()

'''Quick note on Subplots.

Often times we might want to plot multiple plots within the same figure. 
For example, we might want to perform a side by side comparison of the 
box plot with the line plot of China and India's immigration.

To visualize multiple plots together, we can create a figure (overall canvas) 
and divide it into subplots, each containing a plot. With subplots, 
we usually work with the artist layer instead of the scripting layer.

Typical syntax is : 

    fig = plt.figure() # Create figure
    ax = fig.add_subplot(nrows, ncols, plot_number) # Create subplots
Where

nrows and ncols are used to notionally split the figure into (nrows * ncols) 
sub-axes,
plot_number is used to identify the particular subplot that this function 
is to create within the notional grid. plot_number starts at 1, increments 
across rows first and has a maximum of nrows * ncols as shown below.(see
Jupyter notebook for the figure)'''

'''We can then specify which subplot to place each plot by passing in the 
ax paramemter in plot() method as follows:'''

#fig = plt.figure() # create figure
#
#ax0 = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1) # add subplot 1 (1 row, 2 columns, first plot)
#ax1 = fig.add_subplot(122) # add subplot 2 (1 row, 2 columns, second plot). See tip below**
#
## Subplot 1: Box plot
#df_CI.plot(kind='box', color='blue', vert=False, figsize=(20, 6), ax=ax0) # add to subplot 1
#ax0.set_title('Box Plots of Immigrants from China and India (1980 - 2013)')
#ax0.set_xlabel('Number of Immigrants')
#ax0.set_ylabel('Countries')
#
## Subplot 2: Line plot
#df_CI.plot(kind='line', figsize=(20, 6), ax=ax1) # add to subplot 2
#ax1.set_title ('Line Plots of Immigrants from China and India (1980 - 2013)')
#ax1.set_ylabel('Number of Immigrants')
#ax1.set_xlabel('Years')
#
#plt.show()

'''** * Tip regarding subplot convention **

In the case when nrows, ncols, and plot_number are all less than 10, 
a convenience exists such that the a 3 digit number can be given instead, 
where the hundreds represent nrows, the tens represent ncols and the units 
represent plot_number. For instance,

   subplot(211) == subplot(2, 1, 1) 
produces a subaxes in a figure which represents the top plot (i.e. the first) 
in a 2 rows by 1 column notional grid (no grid actually exists, 
but conceptually this is how the returned subplot has been positioned).'''


'''Let's try something a little more advanced.

Previously we identified the top 15 countries based on total immigration 
from 1980 - 2013.

Question: Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of the top 
15 countries (based on total immigration) grouped by the decades 
1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.

Step 1: Get the data set. This will be broken into two parts as follows:'''

# 1. get the top 15 countries based on Total immigrant population
df_top15 = df_can.sort_values(['Total'], ascending=False, axis=0).head(15)
df_top15  

# 2. create a new dataframe which contains the aggregate for each decade

# let us get a list of all years in decades 80's and 90's
years_80s = list(map(str, range(1980, 1990))) 
years_90s = list(map(str, range(1990, 2000))) 
years_00s = list(map(str, range(2000, 2010))) 

# slice the original dataframe df_can to create a series for each decade
df_80s = df_top15.loc[:, years_80s].sum(axis=1) 
df_90s = df_top15.loc[:, years_90s].sum(axis=1) 
df_00s = df_top15.loc[:, years_00s].sum(axis=1)

# merge the two series into a new data frame
new_df = pd.DataFrame({'1980s': df_80s, '1990s': df_90s, '2000s':df_00s}) 

print(new_df)
#new_df.describe()

new_df.plot(kind='box', figsize=(10, 6))

plt.title('Immigration from top 15 countries for decades 80s, 90s and 2000s')

plt.show()

'''Noticie how the box plot differs from the summary table created. 
The box plot scans the data and identifies the outliers. 
In order to be an outlier, the data value must be:

larger than Q3 by at least 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR), or,
smaller than Q1 by at least 1.5 times the IQR.
Let's look at decade 2000s as an example: 

Q1 (25%) = 36,101.5 
Q3 (75%) = 105,505.5 
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 69,404 
Using the definition of outlier, any value that is greater than 
Q3 by 1.5 times IQR will be flagged as outlier.

Outlier > 105,505.5 + (1.5 * 69,404) 
Outlier > 209,611.5'''

# let's check how many entries fall above the outlier threshold 
new_df[new_df['2000s']> 209611.5]

'''China and India are both considered as outliers since their population 
for the decade exceeds 209,611.5.'''




'''-----------------------------SCATTER PLOTS-------------------------'''
'''A scatter plot (2D) is a useful method of comparing variables against each 
other. Scatter plots look similar to line plots in that they both map 
independent and dependent variables on a 2D graph. While the datapoints are 
connected together by a line in a line plot, they are not connected in a 
scatter plot. The data in a scatter plot is considered to express a trend. 
With further analysis using tools like regression, we can mathematically 
calculate this relationship and use it to predict trends outside the dataset.

Let us start by exploring the following:

Question: Using a scatter plot, visualize the trend of total immigrantion to 
Canada (all countries combined) for the years 1980 - 2013.

Step 1: Get the data set. Since we are expecting to use the 
relationship betewen years and total population, we will convert 
years to float type.'''

# we can use the sum() method to get the total population per year
df_tot = pd.DataFrame(df_can[years].sum(axis=0))

# change the years to type float (useful for regression later on)
df_tot.index = map(float,df_tot.index)

# reset the index to put in back in as a column in the df_tot dataframe
df_tot.reset_index(inplace = True)

# rename columns
df_tot.columns = ['year', 'total']

# view the final dataframe
df_tot.head()


'''Step 2: Plot data. In Matplotlib, we can create a scatter plot set by 
passing in kind='scatter' as plot argument. We will also need to pass 
in x and y keywords to specify the columns that go on the x and y axis.'''

df_tot.plot(kind='scatter', x='year', y='total', figsize=(10, 6), color='darkblue')

plt.title('Total Immigration to Canada from 1980 - 2013')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Immigrants')

plt.show()

'''Notice how the scatter plot does not connect the datapoints together. 
We can clearly observe an upward trend in the data: as the years go by, 
the total number of immigrants increases. We can mathematically analyze this 
upward trend using a regression line (line of best fit).

Question: Plot a linear line of best fit, and use it to predict the number of 
immigrants in 2015.

Step 1: Get the equation of line of best fit. We will use Numpy's polyfit() 
method by passing in the following:

x: x-coordinates of the data.
y: y-coordinates of the data.
deg: Degree of fitting polynomial. 1 = linear, 2 = quadratic, and so on'''

x = df_tot.year      # year on x-axis
y = df_tot.total     # total on y-axis
fit = np.polyfit(x, y, deg=1)

#fit

'''The output is an array with the polynomial coefficients, highest powers first. 
Since we are plotting a linear regression y= a*x + b, our output has 2 
elements [5.56709228e+03, -1.09261952e+07] with the the slope in position 
0 and intercept in position 1.

#Step 2: Plot the regression line on the scatter plot.'''
df_tot.plot(kind='scatter', x='year', y='total', figsize=(10, 6), color='darkblue')

plt.title('Total Immigration to Canada from 1980 - 2013')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Immigrants')

# plot line of best fit
plt.plot(x,fit[0]*x + fit[1], color='red') # recall that x is the Years
plt.annotate('y={0:.0f} x + {1:.0f}'.format(fit[0], fit[1]), xy=(2000, 150000))

plt.show()

# Print out the line of best fit
'No. Immigrants = {0:.0f} * Year + {1:.0f}'.format(fit[0], fit[1])


'''Using the equation of line of best fit, we can estimate the number of immigrants 
in 2015:

No. Immigrants = 5567 * Year - 10926195
No. Immigrants = 5567 * 2015 - 10926195
No. Immigrants = 291,310
When compared to the actuals from Citizenship and Immigration Canada's 
(CIC) 2016 Annual Report, we see that Canada accepted 271,845 immigrants in 2015. 
Our estimated value of 291,310 is within 7% of the actual number, 
which is pretty good considering our original data came from United Nations 
(and might differ slightly from CIC data).

As a side note, we can observe that immigration took a dip around 1993 - 1997. 
Further analysis into the topic revealed that in 1993 Canada introcuded 
Bill C-86 which introduced revisions to the refugee determination system, 
mostly restrictive. Further amendments to the Immigration Regulations 
cancelled the sponsorship required for "assisted relatives" and reduced the 
points awarded to them, making it more difficult for family members 
(other than nuclear family) to immigrate to Canada. 
These restrictive measures had a direct impact on the immigration 
numbers for the next several years.'''


'''----------------------------BUBLE PLOTS----------------------------'''

'''A bubble plot is a variation of the scatter plot that displays three dimensions 
of data (x, y, z). The datapoints are replaced with bubbles, and the size of 
the bubble is determined by the third variable 'z', also known as the weight. 
In maplotlib, we can pass in an array or scalar to the keyword s to plot(), 
that contains the weight of each point.

Let's start by analyzing the effect of Argentina's great depression.

Argentina suffered a great depression from 1998 - 2002, which caused 
widespread unemployment, riots, the fall of the government, and a 
default on the country's foreign debt. In terms of income, over 50% of 
Argentines were poor, and seven out of ten Argentine children were poor at 
the depth of the crisis in 2002. Let us analyze the effect of this crisis, 
and compare Argentina's immigration to that of it's neighbour Brazil.

Question: Plot a bubble plot of immigration from Brazil and Argentina for the 
years 1980 - 2013. Set the weights for the bubble as the normalized value of 
the population for each year.

Step 1: Get the data for Brazil and Argentina. Like in the previous example, 
we will convert the Years to type float and bring it in the dataframe.'''

df_can_t=df_can[years].transpose() # transposed dataframe

# cast the Years (the index) to type float
df_can_t.index = map(float,df_can_t.index)

# let us label the index. This will automatically be the column name when we reset the index
df_can_t.index.name = 'Year'

# reset index to bring the Year in as a column
df_can_t.reset_index(inplace = True)

# view the changes
df_can_t.head(3)

'''Step 2: Create the normalized weights.

There are several methods of normalizations in statistics, each with its own 
use. In this case, we will use feature scaling to bring all values into the 
range [0,1]. The general formula is: X' = (X-Xmin) / (Xmax-Xmin)

where X is an original value, X' is the normalized value. The formula sets the 
max value in the dataset to 1, and sets the min value to 0. The rest of the 
datapoints are scaled to a value between 0-1 accordingly.'''

norm_brazil = (df_can_t.Brazil - df_can_t.Brazil.min()) / (df_can_t.Brazil.max() - df_can_t.Brazil.min())
norm_argentina = (df_can_t.Argentina - df_can_t.Argentina.min()) / (df_can_t.Argentina.max() - df_can_t.Argentina.min())

#norm_brazil

'''Step 3: Plot the data.

To plot two different scatter plots in one plot, we can include the axes one 
plot into the other by passing it via the ax parameter.

We will also pass in the weights using the s parameter. Given that the 
normalized weights are between 0-1, they won't be visible on the plot. 

Therefore we will:
multiply weights by 2000 to scale it up on the graph, and,
add 10 to compensate for the min value (which has a 0 weight and 
therefore scale with x2000).'''
